# Wireshark Packet Analysis

## Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic in a controlled lab environment.

## Lab Environment
- Kali Linux running on VMware Workstation Pro
- Wireshark for packet capture

## Procedure
1. Started packet capture on active network interface.
2. Generated web traffic by visiting a website.
3. Filtered traffic using:
   http
   dns
   tcp

## Observations
- Observed DNS queries resolving domain names.
- Identified TCP handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- Examined HTTP request and response structure.

## Key Learnings    
- How data travels across a network
- Structure of TCP handshake
- Basic packet filtering techniques

## Reflection
This exercise strengthened my understanding of network communication and deepened my awareness of how attackers and defenders analyze traffic in cybersecurity operations.
